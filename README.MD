# Yoinky :: System Monitor

![Yoinky Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/YOUR_SCREENSHOT_ID.png) <!-- Replace with a real screenshot URL -->

A lightweight and efficient terminal-based system monitor for Linux, built with Rust. Yoinky provides a real-time, at-a-glance view of your system's key metrics in a clean and boxy terminal user interface.

## Features

- **CPU Monitoring**: Tracks core count, temperature, and overall usage percentage.
- **RAM Monitoring**: Displays current memory usage with a progress gauge.
- **GPU Monitoring**: Detects GPU type (Nvidia/AMD) and shows its temperature.
- **Disk Monitoring**: Shows total disk usage for your root partition.
- **Modern TUI**: A clean, segmented interface built with `ratatui`.
- **Lightweight**: Written in Rust for performance and low resource consumption.

## Technology Stack

- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**: The core programming language, chosen for its safety and performance.
- **[ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/)**: A TUI (Terminal User Interface) library for creating rich, interactive terminal applications.
- **[crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm)**: A terminal manipulation library used as a backend for `ratatui`.
- **[procfs](https://github.com/eminence/procfs)**: A library to access system and process information from the `/proc` filesystem on Linux.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (and Cargo) installed on your system.
- On NVIDIA systems: `nvidia-smi` command-line tool must be installed and in your PATH.
- On AMD systems: `rocm-smi` may be required for temperature readings on newer cards.
